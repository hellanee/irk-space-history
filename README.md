# IRKUTSK \<SPACE\> HISTORY
Just a small site about people who were born in one Russian city and contributed to space exploration. It was my school project for Web-development subject, so i decided to make a pun in the title, "space" is used in two meanings: as a physical universe beyond the Earth's atmosphere and a key on the computer keyboard (with arrows in the style of HTML tag).
